📚 Job Portal Application

This is a Job Portal Application built using Spring Boot. It follows a layered architecture with Controller, Service, and Repository layers to handle Job, Company, and Review modules.

The application communicates with a database to store and retrieve data, and interacts with the client via a web browser.

⸻

🗂 Project Structure

The architecture is divided into three main layers:
	•	Controller Layer: Handles incoming HTTP requests from the browser (client-side).
	•	Service Layer: Contains business logic and coordinates between the controller and repository layers.
	•	Repository Layer: Communicates with the database to perform CRUD operations.

⸻

🧩 Modules

The application has three main modules:
	•	Job
	•	Company
	•	Review

Each module has its own controller, service, and repository classes to maintain a clean and scalable architecture.

⸻

📌 How It Works
	1.	The Browser (client) sends a request to the Controller.
	2.	The Controller processes the request and forwards it to the Service.
	3.	The Service executes the business logic and interacts with the Repository.
	4.	The Repository performs database operations.
	5.	The response flows back to the Browser through the Controller.
