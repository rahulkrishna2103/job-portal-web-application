# üìö Job Portal Application

This is a *Job Portal Application* built using *Spring Boot. It follows a layered architecture with **Controller, **Service, and **Repository* layers to handle *Job, **Company, and **Review* modules.

The application communicates with a database to store and retrieve data, and interacts with the client via a web browser.

---

## üìÅ Project Structure

The architecture is divided into three main layers:

- *Controller Layer*: Handles incoming HTTP requests from the browser (client-side).
- *Service Layer*: Contains business logic and coordinates between the controller and repository layers.
- *Repository Layer*: Communicates with the database to perform CRUD operations.

---

## üß© Modules

The application has three main modules:

- *Job*
- *Company*
- *Review*

Each module has its own controller, service, and repository classes to maintain a clean and scalable architecture.

---

## üìå How It Works

1. The *Browser* (client) sends a request to the *Controller*.
2. The *Controller* processes the request and forwards it to the *Service*.
3. The *Service* executes the business logic and interacts with the *Repository*.
4. The *Repository* performs database operations.
5. The response flows back to the *Browser* through the *Controller*.
